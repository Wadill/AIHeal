# AIHeal Roadmap

Welcome to the **AIHeal Roadmap**, a visionary journey to transform healthcare into a decentralized, AI-powered public good using the **Aleo** zero-knowledge Layer 1 blockchain. This roadmap outlines the evolution of AIHeal from ideation to a global healthcare ecosystem. Let’s dive into the waves of innovation!

---

## Overview
AIHeal leverages Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and **Aleo’s** native zero-knowledge proofs, private execution, and programmable privacy to create a secure platform for medical record management, real-time AI diagnostics, and verifiable data sharing via Intelligent Health NFTs (INFTs). This roadmap is a creative blueprint to guide development, testing, deployment, and scaling.

---

## Wave 1: Ideation and Initial Development
  
**Objective**: Spark the vision and build a proof-of-concept demo to lay the foundation.

### Milestones
- **Idea Generation**: Conceptualized a privacy-first decentralized healthcare app where patients truly own their data, providers gain zk-verified AI insights, and INFTs ensure selective verifiability without exposure.
- **Demo Creation**: Developed a basic Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS, integrated Aleo for a smart contract to create INFTs, and stored encrypted sample data with private references.
- **Initial Testing**: Ran the demo on a local Aleo node/sandbox, ensuring wallet connectivity with RainbowKit and zk-proof generation.

### Illustration
```
   [Patient] --> [Wallet Login] --> [Aleo: INFT Creation + zk Proof] --> [Private Storage: Encrypted Data]
          |                       |
          v                       v
    [Idea Spark]           [Demo Prototype]
```
- **Visual Description**: Imagine a patient stepping into a digital health portal, their journey marked by a glowing wallet icon leading to an Aleo zk node minting an INFT with privacy proofs, data securely shielded in a zero-knowledge vault. The "Idea Spark" ignites the process, and the "Demo Prototype" emerges as a seedling of innovation.

---

## Wave 2: MVP Development
 
**Objective**: Evolve the demo into a minimum viable product (MVP) with functional AI and privacy-preserving data-sharing capabilities.

### Milestones
- **AI Integration**: Deployed a diagnostic AI model with off-chain/private inference, committing zk-verified results to Aleo for analyzing health data (e.g., predicting risks from vitals), accessible via a chat interface.
- **Data Sharing**: Enhanced the smart contract on Aleo to allow selective, zk-proven data access for providers (zero-knowledge credentials), ensuring no unnecessary exposure.
- **UI Enhancement**: Upgraded the frontend with a conversational UI, where users can ask, “What’s my health trend?” and receive visual responses backed by private proofs.
- **Testing Phase**: Rigorously tested on the Aleo testnet, optimizing proof generation times and ensuring contract reliability with native privacy.

### Illustration
```
   [User] --> [Chat UI] --> [Private AI Inference + zk Proof] --> [Health Insight]
          |                       |                        |
          v                       v                        v
    [Wallet] --> [Aleo: zk Share Permission] --> [Private Data Access]
```
- **Visual Description**: Picture a user engaging with a sleek chat window, their input flowing to private AI where zero-knowledge proofs verify analysis without revealing data, delivering insights. Parallelly, their wallet unlocks a zk-gated permission on Aleo, with private data flowing securely like a shielded heartbeat monitor pulsing with confidential information.

---

## Wave 3: Production-Ready Deployment
 
**Objective**: Launch a production-ready platform, inviting early adopters with a polished, privacy-by-default experience.

### Milestones
- **Live Deployment**: Released the app on Vercel, with smart contracts deployed to Aleo mainnet, offering free initial zk-operations to new users.
- **Feature Rollout**: Introduced a status dashboard to monitor Aleo zk services, a chat panel for generating health charts (e.g., “Show my blood pressure trends” with private proofs), and selective community sharing options.
- **Scalability**: Added cross-chain bridges (e.g., for Ethereum compatibility) and migrated APIs to a robust backend for production stability.
- **User Engagement**: Created a demo video showcasing a user generating a stable health metric chart via zk-verified AI, shared anonymously with the community.

### Illustration
```
   [User] --> [Wallet Login] --> [Status Dashboard] --> [Chat Panel: "Chart Request"]
          |                       |                        |
          v                       v                        v
    [Credits] --> [Aleo Mainnet + zk Proofs] --> [Private Compute: Chart] --> [Community Share]
```
- **Visual Description**: Envision a user logging in with a glowing wallet, greeted by a control panel (Status Dashboard) showing Aleo’s zk health. They request a chart via the Chat Panel, credits flow to Aleo mainnet for proof generation, and private compute crafts a visual, shared like a digital health bulletin board with the community—all without leaking data.

## Wave 4: Scaling and Partnerships
 
**Objective**: Scale the platform globally and forge strategic partnerships to enhance its impact.

### Milestones
- **Traction Goal**: Aim for 100+ active users through free zk-operations promotions and community outreach.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with healthcare organizations, wearable providers, and AI model developers to integrate specialized zk-secured models and datasets.
- **Advanced Features**: Implement cross-chain interoperability, a mobile app for on-the-go private access, and community-contributed AI tools for collaborative, privacy-preserving research.
- **Sustainability**: Introduce a token-based system ($AIHEAL) for zk-fees, long-term funding, and user engagement via DAO governance.

### Illustration
```
   [User Base] --> [Partnerships] --> [Cross-Chain zk Network] --> [Mobile App]
          |                       |                        |
          v                       v                        v
    [100+ Users] --> [zk AI Tools] --> [Token Economy] --> [Global Impact]
```
- **Visual Description**: Visualize a growing user base branching into partnerships, like roots of a tree, connecting to a cross-chain zk network (a web of privacy-shielded nodes). A mobile app blooms as the fruit, supported by zk-secured AI tools and a token economy, culminating in a globe symbolizing global, private healthcare transformation.
